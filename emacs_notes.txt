C-u X * --> Will insert 8 * at cursor

TO STOP - Use C-g

C-l C-l --> IMPORTANT - Repositions screen so that current cursor is top of page

M - Y IMPORTANT - Yank back from the Ring

C - / Undo

C-z - Suspend Emacs
%emacs (type in shell) - to resume from where you left off

C -s Forward Search
C -r Reverse Search

C-x 2 - Split Screen in 2
C-x o - Switch to the other buffer

C-M-v Scroll the other window

C-x C-f - Find a file

C-x s - save some buffer

C-x C-s Save

	C-x C-f		Find file
	C-x C-s		Save file
	C-x s		Save some buffers
	C-x C-b		List buffers
	C-x b		Switch buffer
	C-x C-c		Quit Emacs
	C-x 1		Delete all but one window
	C-x u		Undo


VERY IMPORTANT

If the computer crashes, you can recover your auto-saved editing by
finding the file normally (the file you were editing, not the auto
save file) and then typing M-x recover-file <Return>.  When it asks for
confirmation, type yes<Return> to go ahead and recover the auto-save
data.


Emacs has many different major modes.  Some of them are meant for
editing different languages and/or kinds of text, such as Lisp mode,
Text mode, etc.  At any time one and only one major mode is active,
and its name can always be found in the mode line just where
"Fundamental" is now.

Major modes are called major because there are also minor modes.
Minor modes are not alternatives to the major modes, just minor
modifications of them.  Each minor mode can be turned on or off by
itself, independent of all other minor modes, and independent of your
major mode.  So you can use no minor modes, or one minor mode, or any
combination of several minor modes.

One minor mode which is very useful, especially for editing
human-language text, is Auto Fill mode.  When this mode is on, Emacs
breaks the line in between words automatically whenever you insert
text and make a line that is too wide.


The margin is usually set at 70 characters, but you can change it
with the C-x f command.  You should give the margin setting you want
as a numeric argument.

>> Type C-x f with an argument of 20.  (C-u 2 0 C-x f).
   Then type in some text and see Emacs fill lines of 20
   characters with it.  Then set the margin back to 70 using
   C-x f again.


* RECURSIVE EDITING LEVELS
--------------------------

Sometimes you will get into what is called a "recursive editing
level".  This is indicated by square brackets in the mode line,
surrounding the parentheses around the major mode name.  For
example, you might see [(Fundamental)] instead of (Fundamental).

To get out of the recursive editing level, type <ESC> <ESC> <ESC>.
That is an all-purpose "get out" command.  You can also use it for
eliminating extra windows, and getting out of the minibuffer.

To use the Help features, type the C-h character, and then a
character saying what kind of help you want.  If you are REALLY lost,
type C-h ? and Emacs will tell you what kinds of help it can give.
If you have typed C-h and decide you do not want any help, just
type C-g to cancel it.

The most basic HELP feature is C-h c.  Type C-h, the character c, and
a command character or sequence; then Emacs displays a very brief
description of the command.

>> Type C-h c C-p.


To get more information about a command, use C-h k instead of C-h c.

>> Type C-h k C-p.

C-h f - Describe a function
C-h a - Apropos, type keyword and emacs will list all commands with word
